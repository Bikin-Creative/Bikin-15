# Bikin 15

Bikin 15 is a cross-gantry, direct drive fdm printer, framed entirely by printed parts. It is capable of replicating itself, and its soon to be designed larger siblings. Kinematics is using a cross-gantry, quad drive cartesian on linear rods. On a base build, with generic unbranded parts, bom is $300ish. With addons, example enclosure, cost should be abt $400. Despite its low cost of entry, its loaded with advance features, mostly only seen in advance printers.
